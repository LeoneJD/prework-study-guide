# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation was to complete the prework for my Bootcamp successfully which will support further learning for the rest of the course and adding context to future lessons.  
- This project has been created in order to learn basics of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript while recording the learning for future reference. Another motivation for creating this project is to share learning; by making this open source information will enable other learners to benefit. 
- This project has solved a number of problems by closing the knowledge gap enabling participation from day 1 of bootcamp; creating a space for learners to store information; and creating open source information that can be shared with other learners, employers and collaborators. 
- This project has taught learners the fundamentals of the basic languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript; while introducing programs that are key to this course and a career in web development such as: Git Bash, Git Hub and Code VS
